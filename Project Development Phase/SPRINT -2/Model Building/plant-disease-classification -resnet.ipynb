Even if you have used TensorFlow in the past and are new to PyTorch, hang in there, everything is explained clearly and concisely.

    "Description of the dataset üìù\n",
    "This dataset is created using offline augmentation from the original dataset. The original PlantVillage Dataset can be found here.This dataset consists of about 87K rgb images of healthy and diseased crop leaves which is categorized into 38 different classes. The total dataset is divided into 80/20 ratio of training and validation set preserving the directory structure. A new directory containing 33 test images is created later for prediction purpose.\n",

    "Saving the model\n",
    "There are several ways to save the model in Pytorch, following are the two most common ways\n",
    "\n",
    "Save/Load state_dict (Recommended)\n",
    "When saving a model for inference, it is only necessary to save the trained model‚Äôs learned parameters. Saving the model‚Äôs state_dict with the torch.save() function will give you the most flexibility for restoring the model later, which is why it is the recommended method for saving models.\n",
    "\n",
    "A common PyTorch convention is to save models using either a .pt or .pth file extension.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that you must call model.eval() to set dropout and batch normalization layers to evaluation mode before running inference. Failing to do this will yield inconsistent inference results.\n",
    "\n",
    "# saving to the kaggle working directory\n",
    "PATH = './plant-disease-model.pth'  \n",
    "torch.save(model.state_dict(), PATH)\n",
    "Save/Load Entire Model\n",
    "This save/load process uses the most intuitive syntax and involves the least amount of code. Saving a model in this way will save the entire module using Python‚Äôs pickle module. The disadvantage of this approach is that the serialized data is bound to the specific classes and the exact directory structure used when the model is saved. The reason for this is because pickle does not save the model class itself. Rather, it saves a path to the file containing the class, which is used during load time. Because of this, your code can break in various ways when used in other projects or after refactors.\n",
    "\n",
    "# saving the entire model to working directory\n",
    "PATH = './plant-disease-model-complete.pth'\n",
    "torch.save(model, PATH)\n",
    "Conclusion\n",
    "ResNets perform significantly well for image classification when some of the parameters are tweaked and techniques like scheduling learning rate, gradient clipping and weight decay are applied. The model is able to predict every image in test set perfectly without any errors !!!!\n",
